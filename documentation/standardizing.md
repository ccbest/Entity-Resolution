## Standardizing Values

## What is standardization?
Pretty straightforward - standardization is the process of converting a non-standard value into a standard one, e.g. "Illinois" to "IL".

### How does Entity-Resolution handle standardization?
You can standardize values simply by providing a callable method that accepts an entlet.
